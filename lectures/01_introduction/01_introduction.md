# Module 1: Course Overview and Introduction 

This module introduces the course, covering an overview of Software Engineering (SE) processes, and a list of challenges related to applying conventional SE practices to develop and service AI-based software systems.  

## Topics covered in this module

Overview of Software Processes:
- Software requirements and specification
- Software development
- Software validation 
- Software evolution

Examples of challenges in developing AI-based systems cited in the module:
- How can we specify functional and non-functional requirements for an AI component?
- How to incorporate AI components in larger systems?
- How to test the corretness of a system that is inherently non-deterministic?
- How to monitor an AI component in production and react to drifts in its behavior?
