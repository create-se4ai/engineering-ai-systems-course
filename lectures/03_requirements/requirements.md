# Module 3: Software Requirements for AI-based Systems 

This module covers an overview of the Requirements Engineering (RE) process and establishes a parallel between RE for traditional systems and the challenges of RE in AI-based systems. 

## Slides

You can find the slides for this module at [Software Requirements for AI systems](03_requirements/03_requirements_slides.pdf).


## Topics covered in this module:

- Requirement Engineering Process
- The challenges of RE for AI-based software systems
  - When is AI needed?
  - How to set up quality expectations for an unknwon ML problem?
  - What funtional and non-functional requirements are needed to evaluate the quality of an AI component?
