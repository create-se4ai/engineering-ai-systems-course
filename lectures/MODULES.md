# Module 1: Course Overview and Introduction 

This module introduces the course, covering an overview of Software Engineering (SE) processes, and a list of challenges related to applying conventional SE practices to develop and service AI-based software systems.  

## Slides

You can find the slides for this module at [Introduction Slides](01_introduction/01_introduction_slides.pdf)

## Topics covered in this module

Overview of Software Processes:
- Software requirements and specification
- Software development
- Software validation 
- Software evolution

Examples of challenges in developing AI-based systems cited in the module:
- How can we specify functional and non-functional requirements for an AI component?
- How to incorporate AI components in larger systems?
- How to test the corretness of a system that is inherently non-deterministic?
- How to monitor an AI component in production and react to drifts in its behavior?

### Reference Material

This module is based on the following reference materials:
-  Software Engineering, by Ian Sommerville (10th edition).  


# Module 2: AI for Software Engineers (Hands on activity)

This module covers the basics of Machine Learning pipelines, from dealing with the data shortcomings, selecting the appropriate model, and training/testing the model.
We include a hands-on component to walk you through the process of building a ML pipeline on a realistic scenario. 

## Slides

You can find the slides for this module at [AI for Software Enfineering Slides](02_mlpipelines_practical_slides.pdf).

## Notebook for the practical session

We prepared a notebook in Kaggle with a pre-defined scenario for implementing a ML pipeline for a classification problem. 
The notebook can be forked and experimented on at [SOEN691_GermanCreditReport](https://www.kaggle.com/code/diegoeliascosta/soen691-germancreditreport).

## Topics covered in this module:

Overview of the ML pipeline:
- The role of data on the quality of AI/ML systems
- Important factors to consider about data to mitigate significantly biasing AI systems
- How to select an appropriate model for a learnable problem considering: assumptions, explainability, stability, overfitting
- Metrics for measuring performance of ML system
