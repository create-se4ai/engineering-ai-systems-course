# Course Project

This folder contains the specifications of each chapter of the course project. The project is developed in groups of 3-4 students and has a practical component (i.e., developing a software system) and a research component (i.e., writing a report and presenting the results).

## Project Description

After organizing themselves in groups, the group of students should select a publicly dataset to build a full fledged system. 
The datasets available for this particular installment are described in the [Datasets](./Datasets%20for%20the%20Course%20Project.pdf) file. 


The report is organized in chapters that should answer the questions in the specification written in the files below:
- [Chapter 1 - Specification of the system](./Chapitre%201%20–%20Spécification%20du%20système.pdf) 
- [Chapter 2 - Architecture of the system](./Chapitre%202%20-%20Architecture%20du%20Système.pdf)
- [Chapter 3 - Data Management and Validation](./Chapitre%203%20-%20Gestion%20et%20validation%20des%20données.pdf)
- [Chapter 4 - Model Selection](./Chapitre%204%20-%20Selection%20des%20Modeles.pdf)
- [Chapter 5 - Testing & Deployment](./Chapitre%205%20-%20Test%20et%20Deployement%20.pdf)
- Chapter 6 - Explaining the system's predictions    

A simplified version of each chapter description is also presented at the end of each class (see the [lectures](../lectures)).
