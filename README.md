# SOEN 691: Engineering AI-Based Software Systems


![SE4AI](images/logo.svg =100x20)

## Course Description

This course introduces key concepts related to the engineering of AI-based software systems. Topics include requirements and architectures of AI-based software systems, data validation and management, model selection, quality assurance, deployment and continuous delivery of AI-based software systems. Additionally, special topics on interpreting and monitoring models, and operations in large-scale AI-based system will be included. A course project involving a real-world open source AI-based software system will be required.
This course is part of the [SE4AI Training Program](https://www.se4ai.org/).


## Background

The development, deployment and servicing of AI-based systems requires specialized training since such systems tend to have fundamental differences compared to traditional software systems. For example, traditional software systems are written to implement a specific behaviour that is expected of the system, whereas, AI-based systems infer their behaviour from training data. In such cases, technical aspects such as debugging if something is wrong becomes much harder since there is no ‘expected output’. The goal of the course is to provide graduate students with the basic and fundamental technical background while exercising SE concepts in the context of an AI-based software system.


## Evaluation Criteria

| Component                    | %   |
| ---------------------------- | --- |
| Class participation          | 10  |
| Paper critiques & activities | 20  |
| Project proposal             | 10  |
| Research project             | 40  |
| Quiz                         | 20  |

You must pass the quizzes and the course project to pass the course.


### Paper Critiques

We will have two assigned research papers on most weeks. Each student is expected to send a critique of one of the papers that are being presented. The critique should include a **brief summary of the paper, at least three strengths of the paper and at least three weaknesses of the paper**. For the other paper, each student is required to submit a summary of the paper. The critiques and paper summaries are due at noon on Fridays before the class. All paper critiques will be graded in detail.

### Research Project

A large portion of the course deliverables is a course research project. You are expected to work on the course project in groups of 4-5 students. Each group is expected to write a research paper by the end of the semester. The topic is to be determined with the instructor. Examples include a new contribution on a specific related topic, a survey paper of a related topic (typically involves surveying 30 – 60 papers), or building a tool to support engineering AI-based software systems.
